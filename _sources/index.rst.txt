ChoraleBricks
=============

One core functionality of this package is to act as an object-relational mapper for the `ChoaraleBricks <https://audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/2024-ChoraleBricks>`_ dataset,
meaning that all data entities are linked and represented as classes.
Furthermore, it offers helpers to easily sample data from this dataset and provides additional annotations such as F0 trajectories or sheet music alignments.
